# Referral Builder

## Todo:

Build the Referral Builder frontend app based on design
Create a simple REST API that would allow creating and reading referrals

## Requirements:

1. As the form is filled out, the preview should be automatically updated
2. The Create button should function to call the Create Referral API endpoint
3. The app should be responsive for different screen widths
4. The form should work in the latest Chrome browser

## Guidelines:

1. Use React as a base library. Feel free to use any react library to complete this task
2. We are interested in your coding style and how you solve problems. To this end, please include your source code and any
   build steps / explanations / set up instructions we may need to test the submission
3. Please structure the code for reusability

## Submission:

- Please submit a complete copy of the source code you wrote for this test.
- Upon submission, please also give us a guide as to how long you spent on the test (there is no wrong answer! We iterate on this test
  based on the average time taken so we can provide an accurate time-frame for future candidates).
- Submission should be pushed to the Git. Just make sure it has public access. (GitHub, Gitlab, etc - your call!)
